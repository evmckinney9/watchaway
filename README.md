I have too many movies on my watch list. TV Time is an okay app for tracking movies, but I think I can design something a) custom designed for the features that I most want to use b) overall better lol.

### Overview:
I like to watch and discuss movies with friends. You have a personal account, but you join groups of people who want to synchronize their watch lists. When you post a movie, kind of like sending a message to multiple group messages, you can post the `to watch` movie into various groups you are a part of. You mark movies as watched and give them ratings. Score = x/5 + y/5, where first score is how much you liked it, second is how good of a movie you think it is. (This is kinda like users being able to model an audience score vs critic score). Then, when you want to request a movie, you can pull from movies that have been rated in the groups you are a part of but havenâ€™t marked as viewed yet. There are optional notes you can rewrite when adding (e.g. where you found the movie, want to watch it) and when marking as viewed (e.g. where did you watch, anything notable happened to you when watching). The movies are collected through a public database (https://thetvdb.com/), and we add our own layer of genre tagging. Finally, we support maury-bot for discord integration.
