Welcome to watchaway, the app used to suggest movies to you based on what your friends want you to watch! With watchaway, you can join groups of people to synchronize your watch lists and share movie recommendations.

How it works:
- Post a movie to various groups you are a part of. You can also include optional notes about where you found the movie or why you want to watch it.
- Mark movies as watched and give them ratings based on how much you liked it and how good you think it is as a movie. The overall score is calculated as the average of these two ratings.
- Request movies from the groups you are a part of by pulling from movies that have been rated but haven't been marked as viewed yet.
- Add your own layer of genre tagging to movies in the app.
- Use maury-bot for Discord integration to easily access your watchaway account through Discord.
- All movie data is collected from the public database at https://thetvdb.com/.

We hope you enjoy using watchaway to keep track of and share your movie recommendations with others!
